When running the bamazonCustomer.js application will first display all of the items available for sale. Included are the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.

## The app will then prompt users with two messages:

The first prompt will ask them which product they would like to buy. The user can then use the arrow keys to scroll through what products are available. The second prompt will ask how many units of the selected product they would like to buy.

If there is not enough of a given item for the order, the app will log the phrase "Insufficient quantity!", prevent the order from going through, and end the appliation.

Once the customer has entered an appropriate quantity, the order will be complete. the application will log out the product selected, the price per, the quantity selected, and the total price.

The SQL database to will update to reflect the remaining quantity.
